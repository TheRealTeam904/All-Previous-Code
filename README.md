This includes all of the (useable) code that I have written in the past two years for Team 904 on my laptop. Most of the code needed will be under a semi-cryptic but mostly usable name on one of the robotics laptops.

WARNING:
  This code is all outdated.
  It is good for an example of how to do many things, but when looking for usable code that will not break the robot or the bones of people around it, I urge you to check the laptop at robotics for the most recent code. 
  I would also encourage that when checking for the most recent code on the laptops, look at the code itself before using it to determine which laptop has the msot up to date code. Then, copy that code to the other laptop, or, even better, begin using github multiple times per day to keep the code the same on both laptops.
  
Have fun and don't break the robot as much as I did!
